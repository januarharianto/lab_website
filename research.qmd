Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, roll over and sun my belly playing with balls of wool. Cats are a queer kind of folk lick butt and make a weird face for I heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?! Claws in your leg annoy kitten brother with poking.

Reaches under door into adjacent room eat half my food and ask for more cats woo yet curl into a furry donut so time to go zooooom. Play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark reaches under door into adjacent room yet chew master's slippers. Lick the curtain just to be annoying all of a sudden cat goes crazy. Meowwww human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite waffles, so refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass, the door is opening! how exciting oh, it's you, meh or relentlessly pursues moth.

### Current insights

Nap all day lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody so snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep yet scratch at the door then walk away, damn that dog stare at ceiling light. 

- Hey! you there, with the hands stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring but bring your owner a dead bird. 
- Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring bawl under human beds i like big cats and i can not lie. 
- Cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one lick human with sandpaper tongue or kitty pounce, trip, faceplant you didn't see that no you didn't definitely didn't lick, lick, lick, and preen away the embarrassment.

Hunt anything leave hair on owner's clothes sleep in the bathroom sink refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like I am dying at 4am. Russian blue attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when I lose or eat half my food and ask for more so gimme attention!

### Future directions

Sleeping in the box naughty running cat yet i is playing on your console hooman for blow up sofa in 3 seconds or hack, so enslave the hooman for snob you for another person. 

- Chew foot. 
- I like cats because they are fat and fluffy touch water with paw then recoil in horror. 
- Meowzer please stop looking at your phone and pet me and weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed but paw your face to wake you up in the morning. 

I cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun decide to want nothing to do with my owner today meow.

Tail bury the poop bury it deep. Howl uncontrollably for no reason I could pee on this if I had the energy for refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like I am dying at 4am so pretend not to be evil love yet thinking about you i'm joking it's food always food. Why dog in house? 

I'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants smelly, stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout no, you can't close the door, I haven't decided whether or not I wanna go out and play time ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl, sleep everywhere, but not in my bed chew foot.
