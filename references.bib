	abstract = {The diversity and distribution of marine species in eastern Australia is influenced by one of the world's strongest western boundary currents, the East Australia Current, which propels water and propagules poleward, a flow intensifying due to climate change. Population genetic structure of the asterinid sea star Meridiastra calcar was investigated across its range in eastern Australia (12° of latitude, 2,500 km) from northern New South Wales to its poleward-extending range in Tasmania at the southern edge influence of the East Australia Current. Population structure and connectivity of M. calcar were examined across six bioregions using six microsatellite loci (nuclear {DNA}) and the control region (mitochondrial {DNA}). The potential influence of the extent of M. calcar's intertidal rock platform habitat was also assessed. Genetic structure analysis indicated that the Hawkesbury Shelf contained distinct genetic clusters, whereas the two sites in the Batemans Shelf differed from each other, with Jervis Bay Marine Park having just one genetic cluster. The Manning Shelf, Twofold Shelf, and Bruny bioregions all had similar genetic composition. Strong self-seeding (68–98\%) was indicated by microsatellite loci for all bioregions, with lower (0.3–6.5\%) migration between bioregions. Poleward (New South Wales to Tasmania) migration was low except from the Manning Shelf (30\%). Contemporary population connectivity and genetic structure of M. calcar appear to be influenced by ocean currents, habitat distribution, and its short planktonic larval duration, which was a minimum of 12–14 days, depending on availability of a settlement cue. The dominance of unique genetic groups in the Hawkesbury bioregion shows the importance of this region for M. calcar and possibly a diversity of co-distributed rock platform species. This highlights how important it is to have a large marine park in the Hawkesbury bioregion, which is presently lacking.},

	abstract = {Body-size and temperature are the major factors explaining metabolic rate, and the additional factor of {pH} is a major driver at the biochemical level. These three factors have frequently been found to interact, complicating the formulation of broad models predicting metabolic rates and hence ecological functioning. In this first study of the effects of warming and ocean acidification, and their potential interaction, on metabolic rate across a broad body-size range (two-to-three orders of magnitude difference in body mass) we addressed the impact of climate change on the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in context with climate projections for east Australia, an ocean warming hotspot. Urchins were gradually introduced to two temperatures (18 and 23 °C) and two {pH} (7.5 and 8.0), and maintained for two months. That a new physiological steady-state had been reached, otherwise know as acclimation, was validated through identical experimental trials separated by several weeks. The relationship between body-size, temperature and acidification on the metabolic rate of H. erythrogramma was strikingly stable. Both stressors caused increases in metabolic rate; 20\% for temperature and 19\% for {pH}. Combined effects were additive; a 44\% increase in metabolism. Body-size had a highly stable relationship with metabolic rate regardless of temperature or {pH}. None of these diverse drivers of metabolism interacted or modulated the effects of the others, highlighting the partitioned nature of how each influences metabolic rate, and the importance of achieving a full acclimation state. Despite these increases in energetic demand there was very limited capacity for compensatory modulating of feeding rate; food consumption increased only in the very smallest specimens, and only in response to temperature, and not {pH}. Our data show that warming, acidification and body-size all substantially affect metabolism and are highly consistent and partitioned in their effects, and for H. erythrogramma near-future climate change will incur a substantial energetic cost.},

	abstract = {The composition of local ecological communities is determined by the members of the regional community that are able to survive the abiotic and biotic conditions of a local ecosystem. Anthropogenic activities since the industrial revolution have increased atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations, which have in turn decreased ocean {pH} and altered carbonate ion concentrations: so called ocean acidification ({OA}). Single-species experiments have shown how {OA} can dramatically affect zooplankton development, physiology and skeletal mineralization status, potentially reducing their defensive function and altering their predatory and antipredatory behaviors. This means that increased {OA} may indirectly alter the biotic conditions by modifying trophic interactions. We investigated how {OA} affects the impact of a cubozoan predator on their zooplankton prey, predominantly Copepoda, Pleocyemata, Dendrobranchiata, and Amphipoda. Experimental conditions were set at either current ({pCO}2 370 μatm) or end-of-the-century {OA} ({pCO}2 1,100 μatm) scenarios, crossed in an orthogonal experimental design with the presence/absence of the cubozoan predator Carybdea rastoni. The combined effects of exposure to {OA} and predation by C. rastoni caused greater shifts in community structure, and greater reductions in the abundance of key taxa than would be predicted from combining the effect of each stressor in isolation. Specifically, we show that in the combined presence of {OA} and a cubozoan predator, populations of the most abundant member of the zooplankton community (calanoid copepods) were reduced 27\% more than it would be predicted based on the effects of these stressors in isolation, suggesting that {OA} increases the susceptibility of plankton to predation. Our results indicate that the ecological consequences of {OA} may be greater than predicted from single-species experiments, and highlight the need to understand future marine global change from a community perspective.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification ({OA}) increases aragonite shell dissolution in calcifying marine organisms. It has been proposed that bacteria associated with molluscan shell surfaces in situ could damage the periostracum and reduce its protective function against shell dissolution. However, the influence of bacteria on shell dissolution under {OA} conditions is unknown. In this study, dissolution in dead shells from gastropod larvae and adult pteropods (Limacina helicina) was examined following a 5-day incubation under a range of aragonite saturation states (Ωarag; values ranging from 0.5 to 1.8) both with and without antibiotics. Gastropod and pteropod specimens were collected from Puget Sound, Washington (48°33′19″N, 122°59′49″W and 47°41′11″N, 122°25′23″W, respectively), preserved, stored, and then treated in August 2015. Environmental scanning electron microscopy ({ESEM}) was used to determine the severity and extent of dissolution, which was scored as mild, severe, or summed (mild + severe) dissolution. Shell dissolution increased with decreasing Ωarag. In gastropod larvae, there was a significant interaction between the effects of antibiotics and Ωarag on severe dissolution, indicating that microbes could mediate certain types of dissolution among shells under low Ωarag. In L. helicina, there were no significant interactions between the effects of antibiotics and Ωarag on dissolution. These findings suggest that bacteria may differentially influence the response of some groups of shelled planktonic gastropods to {OA} conditions. This is the first assessment of the microbial–chemical coupling of dissolution in shells of either gastropod larvae or adult L. helicina under {OA}.},

We investigated the effects of acclimation to increased temperature in the Australian sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma. After a gradual introduction to increasing temperature (1 °C 6 day−1), sea urchins were held for {\textasciitilde} 3 months in four treatments at three elevated temperatures (22, 24 and 26 °C) and the median annual temperature, 20 °C. The effect of elevated temperature on survival, metabolic rate, Q10, heat-shock protein ({HSP}70) expression, gonad index and gonad histology were examined. There was no detectable effect of temperature on metabolic rate for the 22 and 24 °C treatments, although survival decreased by 23\% in the 24 °C treatment and there was an increase in mean {HSP}70 expression. At 26 °C, metabolic rate was lower than at 22 and 24 °C, but was similar to controls, indicating that metabolic depression may have occurred, whereas survival decreased by 31\% and {HSP}70 expression increased threefold. It is clear that there is an active physiological response in urchins held at the highest temperatures. The deleterious effect of living at temperatures projected for the future indicates that the persistence of future populations of H. erythrogramma will depend on acclimation as habitat warming continues.},

As respirometry datasets become increasingly large and analytical approaches more complex, manipulating the data remains a challenge and often intractable with existing tools. Here we describe the {respR} R package, a collection of functions that implement a workflow-based approach to automate the analysis and visualisation of respirometry data. The package can be used for closed, intermittent flow, flow-through and open-tank respirometry and uses well-defined sets of rules to reliably and rapidly generate reproducible results. We demonstrate how {respR} uses novel computing methods such as rolling regressions and kernel density estimates to reliably detect maximum, minimum and most linear sections of the data, and critical oxygen tension, . Although designed specifically with aquatic respirometry in mind, the object-oriented approach of the package and the unit-less nature of its analytical functions mean that parts of the package can easily be used to estimate linear relationships from a range of applications in many research disciplines.},

While the impacts of climate scenario-based ocean warming are well investigated, the response of organisms to extreme events such as {MHW} is less understood. In this study, the thermal tolerance of the amphipod Hyale niger, an ecologically important amphipod in southeast Australia, and its algal host Sargassum linearifolium, were determined. For H. niger, a broad temperature range (2–33 °C) was tested in 6-day exposures in three seasons (summer, autumn and winter) and extended to 11 days in summer. Despite the 7 °C difference in mean habitat temperature across seasons, H. niger had a similar broad thermal optimum (Topt) range with ≥ 90\% survival across a 17–20 degree temperature range. The upper lethal temperature with 50\% mortality in the 6-day tests was also similar across seasons ({LT}50 29–30 °C). In 11-day tests in summer, the {LT}50 was reduced to 26 °C. Cold tolerance of H. niger indicated potential for poleward migration. Sargassum linearifolium had a similar broad thermal tolerance with a 50\% reduction in the photosynthetic capacity at 33 °C. Temperature significantly affected survival of H. niger depending on the size and sex. The decrease in the Topt range over time pointed to the deleterious influence of prolonged heatwaves. The broad thermal tolerance of H. niger and S. linearifolium suggests that this important amphipod–host system may be resilient to habitat warming.},

While knowledge of biological responses of organisms to oceanic stress has emerged from single-species experiments, these do not capture ecologically relevant scenarios where the potential for multi-organism physiological interactions is assessed. Marine algae provide an interesting case study, as their photosynthetic activity elevates {pH} in the surrounding microenvironment, potentially buffering more acidic conditions for associated epiphytes. We present findings that indicate increased tolerance of an important epiphytic foraminifera, Marginopora vertebralis, to the effects of increased temperature (±3°C) and {pCO}2 ( 1,000 µatm) when associated with its common algal host, Laurencia intricata. Specimens of M. vertebralis were incubated for 15 days in flow-through aquaria simulating current and end-of-century temperature and {pH} conditions. Physiological measures of growth (change in wet weight), calcification (measured change in total alkalinity in closed bottles), photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), total chlorophyll, photosynthesis (oxygen flux), and respiration were determined. When incubated in isolation, M. vertebralis exhibited reduced growth in end-of-century projections of ocean acidification conditions, while calcification rates were lowest in the high-temperature, low-{pH} treatment. Interestingly, association with L. intricata ameliorated these stress effects with the growth and calcification rates of M. vertebralis being similar to those observed in ambient conditions. Total chlorophyll levels in M. vertebralis decreased when in association with L. intricata, while maximum photochemical efficiency increased in ambient conditions. Net production estimates remained similar between M. vertebralis in isolation and in association with L. intricata, although both production and respiration rates of M. vertebralis were significantly higher when associated with L. intricata. These results indicate that the association with L. intricata increases the resilience of M. vertebralis to climate change stress, providing one of the first examples of physiological buffering by a marine alga that can ameliorate the negative effects of changing ocean conditions.},

The urchins were slowly introduced to stressor conditions in the laboratory over a 7-week adjustment period to three temperature (ambient, +2 °C, +3 °C) and two {pH} (ambient: {pHT} 8.0; -0.4 units: {pHT} 7.6) treatments.

Survival was monitored through week 22 and metabolic rate was measured at 4 and 12 weeks of acclimation, feeding rate and ammonia excretion rate at 12 weeks and assimilation efficiency at 13 weeks. Acclimation to +3 °C was deleterious regardless of {pH}. Mortality from week 6 indicated that recent marine heatwaves are likely to have been deleterious to this species. Acclimation to + 2 °C did not affect survival. Increased temperature decreased feeding and increased excretion rates, with no effect of acidification. While metabolic rate increased additively with temperature and low {pH} at week 4, there was no difference between treatments at week 12, indicating physiological acclimation in surviving urchins to stressful conditions. Regardless of treatment, H. erythrogramma had a net positive energy budget indicating that the responses were not due to energy limitation. To test for the effect of parental acclimation on offspring responses, the offspring of acclimated urchins were reared to the juvenile stage in {OW} and {OA} conditions. Parental acclimation to warming, but not acidification altered juvenile physiology with an increase in metabolic rate. Our results show that incorporation of gradual seasonal environmental change in long-term acclimation can influence outcomes, an important consideration in predicting the consequences of changing climate for marine species.},
